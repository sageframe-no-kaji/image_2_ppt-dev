# PPTX Builder - Docker Setup

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and start the web UI

## Commands

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Stop services
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f pptx-builder

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up -d --build

# Stop and remove everything
docker compose down -v
```

## Features

✅ **Web UI** - Simple drag-and-drop interface
✅ **Auto-cleanup** - Temp files purged after 30 days
✅ **No storage needed** - Everything in temp, auto-deleted
✅ **Health checks** - Container auto-restarts if unhealthy
✅ **2GB temp space** - Plenty for processing

---

## Access

- **Local**: http://localhost:7860
- **Network**: http://YOUR-IP:7860

## Cleanup Service

The `cleanup` service runs daily to remove files older than 30 days:
- Searches for `pptx_builder_*` temp directories
- Searches for `pptx_pdf_*` temp directories
- Removes anything older than 30 days

---

## Customization

### Change Port

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:7860"  # Now accessible at port 8080
```

### Increase Temp Storage

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
tmpfs:
  - /tmp:size=5G,mode=1777  # Increase to 5GB
```

### Change Cleanup Interval

Edit the cleanup service's `sleep` value:
```yaml
sleep 43200;  # Run twice daily (43200 = 12 hours)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Container won't start
```bash
docker compose logs pptx-builder
```

### Out of disk space
```bash
# Manual cleanup
docker compose exec pptx-builder sh -c "find /tmp -name 'pptx_*' -mtime +1 -delete"
```

### Port already in use
Change the port in `docker-compose.yml` or stop the conflicting service.

## Development

To run locally without Docker:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-web.txt
python app.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:7860
